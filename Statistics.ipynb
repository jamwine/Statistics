    "## Central Tendency\n",
    "The *mean, median, mode* are the three statistical measures for analyzing the __central tendency__ of data. These measures are used to find the central value of the data to summarize the entire data set. There are three additional measures of central tendency: the *trimean*, the *geometric mean*, and the *trimmed mean*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean $(\\bar x)$\n",
    "The **mean** or **average** is the one number that best represents all these data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar x=\\frac{x_1+x_2+...+x_n}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Median\n",
    "The __median__ is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample (a population or a probability distribution). For a data set, it may be thought of as the \"middle\" value. The basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the mean is that it is not skewed so much by extremely large or small values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">The mean and the median are the same for symmetric distributions.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mode\n",
    "The __mode__ of a set of data values is the value that appears most often. It is the value x at which its probability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">The mean of the dataset would always change if there is a change in any value of the dataset. Median and mode may or may not change with altering a single value in the dataset.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trimean\n",
    "The __trimean__ is a weighted average of the 25th percentile, the 50th percentile, and the 75th percentile. Letting $P_{25}$ be the 25th percentile, $P_{50}$ be the 50th and $P_{75}$ be the 75th percentile, the formula for the trimean is:\n",
    "$$Trimean=\\frac{P_{25}+2P_{50}+P_{75}}{4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The median $P_{50}$ is weighted twice as much as the 25th and 75th percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometric mean\n",
    "The __geometric mean__ is computed by multiplying all the numbers together and then taking the nth root of the product. For example, for the numbers 1, 10, and 100, the product of all the numbers is: 1 x 10 x 100 = 1,000. Since there are three numbers, we take the cubed root of the product (1,000) which is equal to 10. The formula for the geometric mean is:\n",
    "$$Geometric Mean=(\\Pi x)^{\\frac{1}{N}}$$\n",
    "where the symbol $\\Pi$ means to multiply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trimmed mean\n",
    "__Trimmed mean__ is obtained by removing some of the higher and lower scores and compute the mean of the remaining scores. A mean trimmed 10% is a mean computed with 10% of the scores trimmed off: 5% from the bottom and 5% from the top. A mean trimmed 50% is computed by trimming the upper 25% of the scores and the lower 25% of the scores and computing the mean of the remaining scores. The trimmed mean is similar to the median which, in essence, trims the upper 49+% and the lower 49+% of the scores. Therefore the trimmed mean is a hybrid of the mean and the median. "

    "## Variability\n",
    "![line](https://github.com/jamwine/Statistics/blob/master/imgs/line.PNG?raw=true)\n",
    "### Range\n",
    "The **Range** describes the extent of variability by considering the distance between the biggest and the smallest values. The larger the range, the more noticeable the variation in the data will be. However, the greatest disadvantage is that it ignores the mean, and is swayed by the outliers; that's where variance comes in.\n",
    "$$range=x_{max}-x_{min}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Deviation\n",
    "For Variance, we first calculate __Mean Deviation__ and __Squared Mean Deviation__:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Mean\\ Deviation=x_i-\\bar x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Squared\\ Mean\\ Deviation=(x_i-\\bar x)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of mean deviations of the individual will always be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance $(\\sigma^2)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "__Variance__ is the second-most important number to summarize this set of data points. It is the mean squared deviation of a variable from its mean. The higher the variance, the larger the variability of the data.\n",

    "Variance is improved by tweaking the denominator - this is called __Bessel's Correction__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance Properties:\n",
    "* If a constant is added to each data point, the variance remains the same. Adding a constant shifts the distribution and doesn't affect variability of the data. The deviations from the mean remains the same as well.\n",
    "* If a constant is multiplied to each observation, the standard deviation increases proportionally to the constant and the variance increases to the squared constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Deviation $(\\sigma)$\n",
    "Mean and variance succinctly summarize a set of numbers. __Standard Deviation__ is the square root of Variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Std Dev=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^2}{n-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![std1](https://github.com/jamwine/Statistics/blob/master/imgs/std1.PNG?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Percentile Rank\n",
    "A __percentile rank__ is typically defined as the proportion of scores in a distribution that a specific score is greater than or equal to. For instance, if there is a score of 95 on a math test and this score was greater than or equal to the scores of 88% of the students taking the test, then the percentile rank would be 88 (88th percentile). Alternatively, percentile rank is sometimes defined simply as the proportion of a distribution that a score is greater than."

    "## Frequency Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of empirical data is called a __frequency distribution__ and consists of a count of the number of occurrences of each value. If the data are continuous, then a grouped frequency distribution is used. Typically, a distribution is portrayed using a frequency polygon or a histogram. Mathematical equations are often used to define distributions. The normal distribution is, perhaps, the best known example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __grouped frequency distribution__ is a frequency distribution in which frequencies are displayed for ranges of data rather than for individual values. For example, the distribution of heights might be calculated by defining one-inch ranges. The frequency of individuals with various heights rounded off to the nearest inch would then be tabulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __histogram__ and a __frequency polygon__ are the graphical representations of a distribution. They partition the variable on the x-axis into various contiguous class intervals of (usually) equal widths. The heights of the _bars_ in a histogram and the _polygon's points_ in a frequency polygon represent the class frequencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "### z-Score\n",
    "A value from any normal distribution can be transformed into its corresponding value on a standard normal distribution using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, __z-score__ is determined in order to normalize the data or standardizing the distribution. The standard normal distribution is sometimes called the __z distribution__. A z score always reflects the number of standard deviations above or below the mean a particular score is.\n",

    "* Most distributions are __Unimodal__ which means it has only one frequently occurring score, clustered at the top while a bimodal has two values occurring frequently.\n",
    "* A __Bimodal distribution__ is a continuous probability distribution with two different modes. These appear as distinct peaks (local maxima) in the probability density function.\n",
    "* A __Uniform Distribution__ has a single value which only occurs in a certain range while anything outside that range is just 0. It’s very much an “on or off” distribution. It as an indication of a categorical variable with 2 categories: 0 or the value. The categorical variable might have multiple values other than 0 and it can be visualized in the same way as a piecewise function of multiple uniform distributions."

    "## Sampling, Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "__Inferential Statistics__ is the branch of statistics concerned with drawing conclusions about a population from a sample. This is generally done through random sampling, followed by inferences made about central tendency, or any of a number of other aspects of a distribution. A __population__ is the complete set of observations. In contrast, a __sample__ is a subset of a population. A sample has to be representative to reflect properties of general population. There are different sampling methods of selecting a subset of a population for the purposes of statistical inference.\n",
    "* In __random sampling__, every member of the population is equally likely to be chosen. \n",
    "* In __stratified random sampling__, the population is divided into a number of subgroups (or strata). Random samples are then taken from each subgroup with sample sizes proportional to the size of the subgroup in the population. For instance, if a population contained equal numbers of men and women, and the variable of interest is suspected to vary by gender, one might conduct stratified random sampling to insure a representative sample.\n",
    "* In __Cluster sampling__, divide the population into groups (clusters). Then a random sample is chosen from the clusters. It’s used when researchers don’t know the individuals in a population but do know the population subsets or groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __representative sample__ is a sample chosen to match the qualities of the population from which it is drawn. With a large sample size, random sampling will approximate a representative sample; stratified random sampling can be used to make a small sample more representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sampling method is __biased__ if each element does not have an equal chance of being selected. For example, a sample of internet users found reading an online statistics book would be a biased sample of all internet users. A random sample is unbiased in nature. Note that possible bias refers to the sampling method, not the result. An unbiased method could, by chance, lead to a very non-representative sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "An estimator is biased if it systematically overestimates or underestimates the parameter it is estimating. In other words, it is biased if the mean of the sampling distribution of the statistic is not the paramter it is estimating, The sample mean is an unbiased estimate of the population mean. The mean squared deviation of sample scores from their mean is a biased estimate of the variance since it tends to underestimate the population variance.\n",

    "The __Central Limit Theorem__ states that given a distribution with a mean μ and variance σ², the sampling distribution of the mean $\\mu_{\\bar x}$ approaches a normal distribution with a mean $\\mu$ and a variance $\\sigma^2/n$ as $n$, the sample size, increases. The amazing and counter-intuitive thing about the central limit theorem is that no matter what the shape of the original distribution, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution. Furthermore, for most distributions, a normal distribution is approached very quickly as $n$ increases. Keep in mind that $n$ is the sample size for each mean and not the number of samples. Remember in a sampling distribution the number of samples is assumed to be infinite. The sample size is the number of scores in each sample; it is the number of scores that goes into the computation of each mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "which says that the mean of the distribution of differences between sample means is equal to the difference between population means for distributions $m_1$, $m_2$. For example, say that the mean test score of all 12-year-olds in a population is 34 and the mean of 10-year-olds is 25. If numerous samples were taken from each age group and the mean difference computed each time, the mean of these numerous differences between sample means would be 34 - 25 = 9."

When asked about the weights they could not supply the exact weight, however they have specified that there are a total of 36 boxes.

The plane can carry a max cargo weight of 2630 lb (or 1193 kg).\n",

    "An __experiment__ or __trial__ is any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes, known as the __sample space__. An experiment is said to be _random_ if it has more than one possible outcome, and _deterministic_ if it has only one. The __sample space__ may be the set of real numbers or a higher-dimensional vector space, or it may be a list of non-numerical values; for example, the sample space of a coin flip would be {heads, tails}.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __Probability Distribution__ is a mathematical function that provides the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. If the random variable X is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss (\"the experiment\"), then the probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 for X = heads, and 0.5 for X = tails (assuming the coin is fair). It is a common mistake to believe that the distribution is the graph when in fact it’s the “rule” that determines how values are positioned in relation to each other.\n",

    "Probability distributions are generally divided into two classes. A **discrete probability distribution** (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes is discrete, such as a coin toss or a roll of dice) can be encoded by a discrete list of the probabilities of the outcomes, known as a __probability mass function__. On the other hand, a __continuous probability distribution__ (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes can take on values in a continuous range (e.g. real numbers), such as the temperature on a given day) is typically described by __probability density functions__ (with the probability of any individual outcome actually being 0). The __normal distribution__ is a commonly encountered continuous probability distribution.\n",

    "Two events (or propositions) are __mutually exclusive__ or __disjoint__ if they cannot both occur at the same time(be true). A clear example is the set of outcomes of a single coin toss, which can result in either heads or tails, but not both. In the coin-tossing example, both outcomes are, in theory, __collectively exhaustive__, which means that at least one of the outcomes must happen, so these two possibilities together exhaust all the possibilities. However, not all mutually exclusive events are collectively exhaustive. For example, the outcomes 1 and 4 of a single roll of a six-sided die are mutually exclusive (both cannot happen at the same time) but not collectively exhaustive (there are other possible outcomes; 2,3,5,6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Events $E_1, E_2, ..., E_n$ are said to be mutually exclusive if the occurrence of any one of them implies the non-occurrence of the remaining $n-1$ events. Therefore, two mutually exclusive events cannot both occur. Formally said, the intersection of each two of them is empty (the null event): $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$. In consequence, mutually exclusive events have the property: $P(A \\cap B) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of events is __jointly__ or __collectively exhaustive__ if at least one of the events must occur. For example, when rolling a six-sided die, the events 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (each consisting of a single outcome) are collectively exhaustive, because they encompass the entire range of possible outcomes. The set of all possible die rolls is both **mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive** (i.e., \"__MECE__\"). The events 1 and 6 are mutually exclusive but not collectively exhaustive.

For example, it may take on the value 0 if an observation is of a male subject or 1 if the observation is of a female subject. The two possible categories associated with the two possible values are mutually exclusive, so that no observation falls into more than one category, and the categories are exhaustive, so that every observation falls into some category.\n",

    "#### Probability of A and B\n",
    "When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events.

    "The probability that event A occurs given that event B has already occurred is called the __conditional probability__ of A given B. Symbolically, this is written as P(A|B). The probability it rains on Monday given that it rained on Sunday would be written as P(Rain on Monday | Rain on Sunday). If Events A and B are not independent, then __P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B|A)__. If Events A and B are independent, P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B).\n",

It can be used to represent a (possibly biased) coin toss where 1 and 0 would represent \"heads\" and \"tails\" (or vice versa), respectively, and $p$ would be the probability of the coin landing on heads or tails, respectively.
